## 🏛️ Platform Architecture

The FinTech AI Platform consists of the following core services:

### 🔧 Core Services
- **API Gateway** (Python/FastAPI) - Main entry point and authentication
- **ML Service** (Python) - Machine learning and AI processing
- **Go Service** (Go) - Orchestration and workflow management
- **Java Service** (Java/Kafka) - Real-time stream processing
- **OCR Service** (C++) - Document text extraction
- **Frontend** (React) - User interface

### 🗄️ Infrastructure
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database
- **Redis** - Caching and session management
- **Kafka** - Message streaming
- **Prometheus** - Metrics collection
- **Grafana** - Monitoring and visualization

### 🔒 Security Features
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- API key management
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Input validation and sanitization

## 📊 Monitoring and Observability

The platform includes comprehensive monitoring:

- **Metrics**: Prometheus collects metrics from all services
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with structured JSON format
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for request flows
- **Alerts**: Automated alerting for critical issues
- **Dashboards**: Pre-configured Grafana dashboards

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Service interaction testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full workflow testing
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability and penetration testing

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The platform uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

1. **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, and security scanning
2. **Testing**: Automated test execution across all services
3. **Building**: Docker image creation and optimization
4. **Deployment**: Automated deployment to staging and production
5. **Monitoring**: Post-deployment health checks

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

- **Throughput**: 1000+ documents per minute
- **Latency**: < 2 seconds for document processing
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling across all services
